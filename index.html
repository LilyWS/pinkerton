    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Pinkerton was released by the band Weezer. I actually hate all of weezer albums except for this one. <br>I haven't really listened to their other albums but my boyfriend says they arent as good.</p>
    <h2>Why I like Pinkerton:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It sounds good but also weird</li>
        <li>I was afraid to like a weezer album at first but if I just like one its probably fine</li>
        <li>It's their least popular album which means I don't have to agree with weezer fans</li>
        <li>The vocalist is good</li>
    </ul>
